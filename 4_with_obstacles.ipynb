    "# Working with obstacles\n",
    "This notebook aims at giving the basis to work with obstacles, first by examplifying the basic API of HPP-FCL, then by writing an optimization problem under noncollision avoidance constraint. One of the main message is that the collision constraint is hard, and that a lot of work remains necessary, to make it efficient in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first show how to compute the minimal ellipsoid that encapsulate a body of the robot. \n",
    "Then a inverse-geometry problem is written under the constraint that a set of points remains outside of the encapsulating ellipsoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is written for a simple UR10 robot, and you should be able to mix it with notebook #3 to make a complete trajectory optimization for a humanoid.\n",
